Created a working chromatic tuner with several features. Specifically, it displays the frequency being played as input, the nearest note and octave to that frequency and a graphical display showing the error estimate of the input frequency compared to the nearest frequency. The frequency being displayed is accurate within 10 geometric cents of the actual frequency being input. It has a menu option to switch into different modes, such as an FFT Histogram, Octave Selection, and Spectrogram mode. All of these features run intuitively so a user would be able to easily use this tool without instruction and run smoothly without noticeable delays or glitches. To achieve these goals we had to combine debouncing of interrupt devices, the HSM, and the FFT algorithm.
